            <p class="black">My name is Ridoy. I’m a recent elementary education graduate from American
                International
                University of
                Bangladesh. I’ve been working at a camp for elementary children this summer, and I’m excited to find
                my
                first teaching position for the coming school year. I have several original lesson plans I created
                during my
                teaching internship that I look forward to implementing in my own classroom.</p>

                essential. Providing examples can help convey the extent of your experience and qualifications.
                Mentioning numbers and data can also make your contributions clearer and help you stand out from the
